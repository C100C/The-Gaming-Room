# The-Gaming-Room
CS-230 Module 8 Journal 


`Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?` 

The Gaming Room is a client we took on wishing to expand their game to more operating platforms. Currently, the game is only available on Android. To expand the game, they wanted the game to be hosted on the web however, they do not know how to set up the    	environment. They wanted the software to meet certain requirements which can be found in the requirement section of the doc.  

   

`What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?`

This was the first time I had done anything like this. Making extensive documentation and outlining what needs to be done for a project is important but it is easier said than done. I believe that I did a respectable job with the design constraints. While in practice it would be harder to identify some constraints, for this project I think I covered most of them with what I was given.  

I also believe that I analyzed the UML diagram quite well. 

   

`What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?`

I found that having an overview of the project helps tremendously when developing the code. The design constraints helped me identify what I can and cannot do. Having a clear set of requirements and constraints is genuinely nice. Without them, you may build an application only to find out it is not what the client wanted. It also helps to give the client recommendations on what they need to do. Everything starts with the constraints and what the user/client wants. This should be considered before any code is written. 

   

`If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?`

I would revise the development requirements section. I was given the table to write in and I like the bullet points better than putting paragraphs into the table. It is hard to read and takes away from the point of the section. The bullet points could also benefit from better formatting. I would use another software to make this table.  

This design doc was created for a non-technical audience in mind. Parts of the doc could be simplified or better explained for a non-technical audience.  

   

`How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?`  

The user is who will be using the application or the game, not the developer. The user’s needs are arguably the most important consideration of software. I interpreted the users' needs here by translating the technical requirements they gave into design patterns and OOP principles. For example, the client wanted team and game names to be unique. In the software, I used the iterator design pattern to search for existing names. This method allows for an abstraction of the data structure.  

   

   

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?  

I approached designing the software by first considering my constraints. What can I and cannot do?  This helped me identify the steps I needed to take to meet the client's needs. In the future, I will get as much information from the client as possible. Making it clear what they want me to make for them. Then translate their needs into design patterns, OOP principles, and other ways to build software.
